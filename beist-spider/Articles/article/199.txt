Two Singaporeans jailed in Abu Dhabi for wearing women¡¯s clothes
SINGAPORE - Two Singaporean men have been each sentenced to a year¡¯s jail in Abu Dhabi for wearing women¡¯s clothes.
Freelance fashion photographer Muhammad Fadli Bin Abdul Rahman, 26, was in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for work. Mr Fadli was travelling with his friend Nur Qistina Fitriah Ibrahim, 37, also known to family and friends as Fifi. Nur is a transgender person who has legally changed the name but has not undergone a sex-change operation to become a woman.
Speaking to The Straits Times, Nur¡¯s 34-year-old younger sister, who wanted to be known only as Madam Rozy, said: "Fifi has not undergone gender reassignment surgery, so her personal documents still state her gender as male. We are a very close-knit family and are very worried for her."
Mr Fadli and Nur landed in Abu Dhabi on Aug 8, and were arrested at the food court of a shopping mall the next day.
An official court document in Arabic said two Singaporean men were caught wearing women¡¯s clothes in public, and for behaving indecently.
Cross-dressing, homosexuality and being transgender are crimes in the UAE.
