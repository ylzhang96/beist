Group-buying site employee fired over discriminatory remarks
China¡¯s group buying website Meituan.com on May 17 issued an official apology for its employee¡¯s offensive remarks about people from provinces in central and northeastern China.
¡°We apologize for our employee¡¯s discriminatory remarks, which go against the company¡¯s values and have exerted a negative social influence. The employee has been removed from his position, as our company advocates for equality and tolerance,¡± Meituan wrote on its Sina Weibo page.
The apology was in response to comments made by Tian Yuan, an HR employee, in which Tian discouraged people from the so-called ¡°inundation areas¡± in Henan, Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces from applying to work for the company. In a recruitment letter posted on the company¡¯s WeChat, Tian stated that the company would not consider job applicants from the regions mentioned above. He also said that applicants with master¡¯s degrees or PhDs would be excluded, as would those who believe in traditional Chinese medicine.
Tian¡¯s remarks quickly went viral online, inciting a major backlash.
¡°Do not meddle with the phrase ¡®inundation areas.¡¯ It represents a humanitarian disaster and is not something you should joke about,¡± one netizen wrote.
Inundation areas mainly refer to Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, where the 1938 Yellow River flood, created by the Kuomintang in an attempt to halt the rapid advance of Japanese invaders, drowned over 800,000 people.
Meituan confirmed that said such wording is unacceptable, and promised to educate its employees.
