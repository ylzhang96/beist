North Korea: US ¡¯never out of diplomatic solutions¡¯
US Defence Secretary James Mattis has said the US is "never out of diplomatic solutions" in dealing with North Korea.
It comes after President Donald Trump tweeted that "talking is not the answer" to the country¡¯s military ambitions.
North Korea caused alarm by firing a missile over Japan on Tuesday.
The missile, which Japan called an "unprecedented" threat, crossed the northern Hokkaido region early on Tuesday, triggering public alerts to take cover, before landing in the sea about 1,180km (730 miles) off the coast.
North Korea later said it was "the first step" of wider military operations in the Pacific, and repeated its threats to the US Pacific island of Guam.
Just days ago, Mr Trump had said he believed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was "starting to respect" the US.
But in a tweet late on Wednesday, he said: "The US has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!"
But when asked whether it was true that the US had lost hope in diplomacy, Mr Mattis openly disagreed with the president saying: "No. We are never out of diplomatic solutions."
He was speaking as he met his South Korean counterpart, Song Young-moo, at the Pentagon.
"We continue to work together, and the minister and I share a responsibility to provide for the protection of our nations, our populations and our interests."
In a phone call on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that diplomacy was the only way to overcome tensions on the Korean peninsula, which have been escalating in recent months.
A military solution would be "fraught with unpredictable consequences," Reuters quoted Mr Lavrov as saying.
He also said any further strengthening of sanctions against North Korea by the UN would be counter-productive.
