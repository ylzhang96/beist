The renovated White House is ready for its close-up
After a few nips and tucks, the White House is making its big reveal. A new batch of photos has been released illustrating 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue¡¯s facelift, which kicked into high-gear earlier this summer when President Trump began his 17-day working vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The president returned to the White House on Sunday.
All of the renovations were conducted by General Service Administration designers. While the White House¡¯s rooms were gussied up, a lot of the upgrades are not visible. These include overhauling the 27-year-old heating and air conditioning system and upgrading the IT system.
The renovations are apparent from the moment one approaches the White House. The South Portico porch, above, for example, features newly-renovated stairs. Inside, the Oval Office, the epicenter of the White House, was renovated with a more consistent-looking aesthetic, including new wallpaper.
Leaks at the White House were also fixed, and the Navy mess kitchen and West Wing lower lobby were also renovated.
Trump took to Twitter earlier this month to deny a report that while speaking with members at the Trump National Golf Club, he said the White House is a "dump."
"I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen," he tweeted. "But Fake News said I called it a dump - TOTALLY UNTRUE."
