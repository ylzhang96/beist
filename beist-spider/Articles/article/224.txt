JK Rowling apologises over Trump disabled boy tweets
Author JK Rowling has apologised for incorrectly accusing Donald Trump of ignoring a disabled boy.
A video emerged that appeared to show the US president refusing to shake the boy¡¯s hand at the White House.
"How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president," the author said.
But Marjorie Kelly Weer, mother of Monty, said Rowling¡¯s interpretation of the clip was wrong.
The Harry Potter author tweeted: "Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proffered hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage.
"Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction¡¯¡¯.
"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly."
Rowling didn¡¯t apologise to Mr Trump himself.
Mr Trump is said to have shaken the boy¡¯s hand as the president entered the room.
Ms Weer wrote on Facebook: "If someone can please get a message to JK Rowling: Trump didn¡¯t snub my son & Monty wasn¡¯t even trying to shake his hand."
She also said her son was not all that keen on shaking hands anyway.
Rowling has deleted her initial tweets on the subject.
