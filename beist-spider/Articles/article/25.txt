Releasing BBC talent salaries will be ¡¯uncomfortable¡¯, says Andrew Marr
The BBC will reveal the salaries of its highest paid stars, in a move which Andrew Marr says will prove ¡°uncomfortable¡±.
In line with new BBC talent pay disclosure rules, outlined in the Royal Charter last year, senior stars earning more than 150,000 pounds fee are to have their exact salaries released.
Senior executives earning more than 150,000 pounds  are already required to release their salaries but the amount high-profile individuals, or ¡°talent¡±, are paid has traditionally been kept secret.
Presenter and broadcaster Andrew Marr spoke at the China Exchange on Friday, where he made his views on the matter clear: ¡°It¡¯s uncomfortable for all of us,¡± the Sunday Telegraph reported.
¡°I¡¯m well paid but I¡¯m much less overpaid, perhaps, than people working for rival organisations who won¡¯t go through this process.¡±
Yet a leaked review of salaries in BBC¡¯s news division in 2016 suggested its journalists were paid some 40 per cent more than those in similar roles at large media companies such as Sky and ITV.
In 2011 Mr Marr¡¯s salary became a topic of intense scrutiny after his payslip led to suggestions his annual income was ?580,00.
