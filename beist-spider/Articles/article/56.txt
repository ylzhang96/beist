¡¯Females working in e-commerce get better pay, more promotions
Female graduates working in e-commerce receive better pay and more promotions, according to a report recently published by education consultancy MyCOS.
Those who work in e-commerce earn average monthly pay of 4,037 yuan ($586), taking the second spot after bank tellers, said the study based on survey of 250,000 graduates in 2012 and 40,000 in 2015.
Based on the salaries of graduates in 2012, the report showed that the salary increase was substantial in the e-commerce sector. The average monthly salary increased by 110% to 6,675 yuan, although the nursing profession beat them to the top spot with nurses reporting average hike of 117%.
The report attributed the high salary in the e-commerce industry to the exponential growth in internet and to the Internet Plus policy. Nurses, on the other hand, earned their high salaries by working overtime and doing night shifts.
Those who chose e-commerce also enjoyed higher rate of promotion. Out of those who graduated in 2012, 69 percent working in e-commerce received a promotion within three years, dwarfing all other professions.
Meanwhile, accountancy, teaching and clerical jobs attracted most female graduates in 2015.
