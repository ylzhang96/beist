Steve Mnuchin¡¯s Former Yale Classmates Urge Him to Resign From Treasury
Over 300 of Steve Mnuchin¡¯s Yale University Class of 1985 classmates have signed a letter asking him to resign as Secretary of the Treasury in response to President Donald Trump¡¯s comments on recent events in Charlottesville.
The letter, which was posted on lettertostevemnuchin.com, addressed Yale¡¯s legacy of graduates serving as presidents, members of the cabinet, and in many other government capacities. Though they rarely, if ever, have requested a classmate step down, regardless of differences in political opinion, his classmates contested Mnuchin¡¯s political alignment doesn¡¯t reflect the ivy league college¡¯s values.
¡°We do so today because President Trump has declared himself a sympathizer with groups whose values are antithetical to those values we consider fundamental to our sacred honor as Americans, as men and women of Yale, and as decent human beings,¡± the letter reads. ¡°President Trump made those declarations loudly, clearly, and unequivocally, and he said them as you stood next to him.¡±
The class members boast an inclusive range of political backgrounds, but said they cannot condone Nazis and white supremacists. ¡°We can disagree on the means of promoting the general welfare of the country, on the size and role of government, on the nature of freedom and security, but we cannot take the side of what we know to be evil.¡±
The letter ended with a plea for action. ¡°We call upon you, as our friend, our classmate, and as a fellow American, to resign in protest of President Trump¡¯s support of Nazism and white supremacy. We know you are better than this, and we are counting on you to do the right thing.¡±
