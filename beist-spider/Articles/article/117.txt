Louise Linton offers curt apology a day after she went on furious tirade at mother-of-three who complained at her for tagging her VERY expensive wardrobe on Instagram photo of official trip
Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has apologized for causing an Instagram farrago after a night of mockery on social media.
Linton, 36, hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons after she posted photos of herself stepping off a taxpayer-funded plane wearing at least $15,000 in clothes and items - and tagged the names of the high-end brands she was wearing.
That invoked the ire of Oregon mom-of-three Jenni Miller, who commented on the photo:  ¡¯Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable¡¯.
¡¯Cute! [kissing face emoji] Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?!¡¯ replied Linton, who recently concluded a Europe honeymoon with Mnuchin.
¡¯Adorable! Do you think the US Govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?¡¯
¡¯Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband?¡¯ continued the TV and movie actress whose new, second husband¡¯s net worth was estimated by Forbes to be more than $500 million.
¡¯I¡¯m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day "trip" than you did,¡¯ she added.
Screenshots of the photos and comments then did the round on Twitter - leading to much mockery and derision.
Finally, on Tuesday afternoon - a day after the social media showdown - Linton¡¯s publicist offered this curt apology: ¡¯I apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive.¡¯
