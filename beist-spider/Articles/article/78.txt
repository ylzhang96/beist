North Korea: Kim Jong Un observes missile-ready hydrogen bomb
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) ¡ª North Korea¡¯s regime has "succeeded in making a more developed nuke," according to the country¡¯s state news agency.
The Korean Central News Agency described it as a "nuke" in its English-language report, but called it a "thermonuclear hydrogen bomb" in the Korean version.
During a visit to the country¡¯s Nuclear Weapons Institute, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "watched an H-bomb to be loaded into new ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile)," KCNA reported.
There was no independent confirmation of the claims.
"The H-bomb, the explosive power of which is adjustable from tens kiloton to hundreds kiloton, is a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals," KCNA reported in English.
Electromagnetic pulse is an intense wave of electrical energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear weapon.
"Nuclear EMP has the demonstrated potential to disrupt, damage, or destroy a wide variety of electrical and electronic equipment," according to the US Department of Energy.
EMP waves can disable all sorts of electrical devices, but their biggest threat is to the electrical grid and long-haul communications, an Energy Department report says. One blast could knock out power and communications over hundreds or even thousands of kilometers, the report says.
The Kim Jong Un regime boasted about its nuclear missile program in Sunday¡¯s report, saying it has the know-how and materials to make as many weapons as it wants.
