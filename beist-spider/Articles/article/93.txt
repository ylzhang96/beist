Next target Guam, North Korea says
(CNN) ¡ª North Korea¡¯s launch of a missile over Japan was a prelude to more military operations directed at the American territory of Guam, North Korean state media warned Wednesday.
North Korean officials told CNN in Pyongyang that Kim was "very satisfied with the performance of the missile."
The launch was "the first step of the military operation of the (North Korean military) in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam," state media said.
Guam governor¡¯s office said in a statement there is no change in the island¡¯s threat level.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe both now believe "pressure on North Korea should be raised to its limit so that North Korea will voluntarily come to the table for dialogue," South Korean presidential spokesman Park Su-hyun said in a statement Wednesday.
The two also agreed that the United Nations Security Council should enact more detailed and effective sanctions against North Korea.
North Korea state media gave more details about the motivation for the launch Wednesday, noting that it came on the 107th anniversary of the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1907.
It said it sent a strong message amid ongoing joint US-South Korean military drills in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula.
Washington and Seoul say are defensive in nature but Pyongyang believes are preparation for an eventual invasion.
