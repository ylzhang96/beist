How much do you make a year compared to the rest of the world? Online tool shows how your salary ranks - and what you could do with it
When it comes to wealth, we generally know how well we¡¯re doing compared to our peers.
But a new online tool enables you to see exactly how you rank on a global level - and the results are sure to be eye-opening.
The average US salary of $44,460, for example, puts you in the top 0.43 per cent of the world; meaning you earn around $23 per hour compared to a factory worker in Ethiopia, who makes just $0.25 in the same time.
Produced by humanitarian charity Care, the Global Rich List also reveals that an hour of that salary can purify enough water to last a child for 77 days elsewhere in the world.
An hour¡¯s average salary could also pay for a trained midwife to deliver two babies safely in a developing country.
Look at higher wages and the numbers become even more startling.
Taylor Swift, for example, is one of the highest paid artists and has earned $170 million in one year.
That would put her in the top 0.0001 per cent of wealthiest people in the world.
This means she would earn an average of $88,541 per hour - enough to purify water for impoverished children to last them for more than 808 years.
An hour of her salary could also pay for a trained midwife to deliver 10,625 babies safely.
