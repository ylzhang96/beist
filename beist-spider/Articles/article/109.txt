Excessive masturbation and soft drinks are blamed for poor fitness of potential recruits to Chinese Army
An increasing number of young Chinese people are too fat and unhealthy to join their nation¡¯s military.
In just one city in China, more than half - 57 per cent - of try-outs were rejected by the army because they failed the physical exam.
According to the state-controlled People¡¯s Liberation Army Daily newspaper, wannabe soldiers in the communist republic are also being found to suffer from liver and kidney problems caused by junk food and alcohol.
One in five was said to be simply too fat to join.
About eight per cent of men applying were found to have unusually large testicular veins caused by excessive masturbation.
Eyesight, too, has been found to be substandard in many applicants - making them unfit for duty in the largest army in the world.
Senior staff blame poor diets and technology including smartphones for the apparent dip in standards among Chinese youth.
It also suggested that the high mineral content in water was partly to blame for liver and gallbladder problems.
But the report - spread by social media app WeChat - did attempt to reassure patriots by stressing that in the USA, 80 per cent of applicants are rejected.
