Triple talaq: India court bans Islamic instant divorce
India¡¯s top court has ruled the practice of instant divorce in Islam unconstitutional, marking a major victory for women¡¯s rights activists.
In a 3-2 majority verdict, the court called the practice "un-Islamic".
India is one of a handful of countries where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in minutes by saying the word talaq (divorce) three times.
The landmark court decision came in response to petitions challenging the so-called "triple talaq" custom.
The cases were filed by five Muslim women who had been divorced in this way and two rights groups.
Women¡¯s rights campaigners have hailed the court¡¯s decision as a historic win.
