Intriguing Photos Reveal Life in North Korea vs. South Korea
One year ago I went on a strictly guided 7-day tour in North Korea, where they took away my passport and didn¡¯t allow me to explore anything on my own.
North Korea was definitely the weirdest country I had ever visited and during my time there I kept wondering what life was like in the neighboring South Korea, which used to be exactly the same country just over 60 years ago! That¡¯s why at the end of that trip I promised myself to visit South Korea this year so that I could compare my experiences in both of those countries.
The pictures you¡¯ll see below show the differences of life in both Koreas.
