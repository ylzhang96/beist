Chinese postdoctoral scholars at Harvard back to "highly magnetic" homeland
Eight Chinese postdoctoral fellows at Harvard Medical School now work at the "Island of Science," a research institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences located on a small island near Shushan Mountain in Hefei, central China¡¯s Anhui province, Guangming Daily reported on Aug. 25.
The eight scholars with strong educational backgrounds returned to China eight years ago. They could have had a bright future in the U.S., but they were attracted by China¡¯s "strong magnetic field."
Eight years ago, the Hefei-based research institute was equipped with a static high magnetic field and an artificial sun for experiments, but other research facilities lagged far behind the advanced level of the world.
However, a dramatic change has taken place on the island over the past eight years. The "Island of Science" has become an incubator, with world-class facilities and a team of more than 50 researchers. The advanced research in static high magnetic fields was ranked second in the world in terms of intensity, and now, these returnees are making concerted efforts to be number one.
Mass entrepreneurship and innovation were encouraged from 2015. Many venture capital firms are seeking opportunities to cooperate with the research center, said Ren Tao, one of the returned scholar from Harvard.
With such good policies, research environment, and treatment, they had no excuse not to achieve world class results, said Zhang Na, another scholar.Chinese postdoctoral scholars at Harvard back to "highly magnetic" homeland
