Forbidden City replica withstands 10-magnitude quake test
A video showing how a replica of the ancient Forbidden City palace can withstand a 10.1 magnitude earthquake went viral online.
The wooden model palace created by specialist carpenters is based on the world¡¯s largest timber-frame architecture inside the Forbidden City, also known the Palace Museum.
From the video, a wooden replica with brackets called dougong, which supports beams and columns, showed its flexibility, even when the jolt measured 9 to 10-maginiute in a test carried out at a lab in Beijing.
The video is part of a documentary entitled ¡°Secrets of China¡¯s Forbidden City,¡± which introduces the history, scale, and functions of the Forbidden City.
It was the first seismic experiment ever performed on a model of an ancient architecture, according to a seismological expert stationed in the Forbidden City.
In its 600 years of history, the Forbidden City has survived 200 devastating earthquakes, including the deadly Tangshan earthquake in 1976.
