¡°He [Muilenburg] remains on the president¡¯s manufacturing council,¡± John Dern, a spokesperson for Boeing, said in a statement to FOX Business.

Earlier Monday, Merck (MRK) CEO Kenneth Frazier, one of the most prominent African-American business executives, resigned from Trump¡¯s business council , in apparent protest of the president¡¯s response to violent clashes in Virginia, saying he was doing so ¡°as a matter of personal conscience¡± and that he felt ¡°a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.¡±

Muilenburg is one of a handful of other CEOs who have not resigned from Trump¡¯s advisory groups after the president failed to mention white nationalist groups specifically in his remarks following the incidents in Charlottesville.
Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity group Blackstone and leader of Trump¡¯s Strategic and Policy Forum, condemned the events in Charlottesville but said he would remain on the forum.
¡°As the president said today, I believe we need to find a path to heal the wounds left by this tragedy and address its underlying causes. Encouraging tolerance and understanding must be a core national imperative and I will work to further that goal,¡± Schwarzman said in a statement.
Jeff Immelt, current chairman of General Electric, will stay on the Manufacturing Council, even though his company said in a statement they have ¡°no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism.¡±Boeing CEO Muilenburg staying on Trump¡¯s business council
