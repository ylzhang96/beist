The investment will be the largest new greenfield investment made by a foreign company in U.S. history, creating 3,000 new jobs, with the potential to grow to 13,000 jobs in the state, Foxconn said in a statement.
This also signifies the start of a series of investments made by Foxconn in U.S. manufacturing. U.S. President Donald Trump and Terry Gou, founder and CEO of Foxconn, made the announcement during a ceremony at the White House.
The new facility, in southeastern Wisconsin, will manufacture LCD panels used in a wide range of sectors£­the latest generation of televisions, self-driving cars, aircraft systems, education and entertainment, as well as healthcare, advanced manufacturing systems, office automation and interactive new retail.
"We are thrilled to build a state-of-the-art display plant in the U.S. heartland. As the first in a series of facilities we will build in several states of the U.S., the plant is part of our bigger plan to create a robust 8K plus 5G ecosystem in U.S.," Gou said.
He added that Wisconsin also offers a talented, hardworking labor force and has a long history in advanced manufacturing, presenting an extraordinary opportunity for the company.
