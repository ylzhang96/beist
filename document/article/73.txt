Kim Jong-un has a ¡®secret son¡¯ who will inherit regime
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un secretly sired a son who¡¯s poised to extend his clan¡¯s rule over the nation, according to a report Sunday.
Kim¡¯s eldest child is a boy believed to have been born in 2010, the Sunday Times of London said, citing claims by South Korean intelligence.
The child¡¯s gender is crucial to the patriarchal bloodline established by Kim¡¯s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founder of the hermit kingdom and creator of its ideology of ¡°juche,¡± or self-reliance.
In addition to the revelation regarding the younger Kim¡¯s son, the Sunday Times said South Korean spies last week told lawmakers that the baby-faced leader¡¯s wife, Ri Sol-ju, gave birth to their third child, a girl, in February.
The report was published hours before North Korea shocked the world with claims that it successfully tested a hydrogen nuclear bomb, prompting President Trump to say, ¡°We¡¯ll see,¡± when asked if the US would mount a military attack in retaliation.Kim Jong-un has a ¡®secret son¡¯ who will inherit regime
