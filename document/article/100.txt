India and China agree to end border standoff, India says
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and China have agreed to an "expeditious disengagement" of troops at a disputed border area where their soldiers have been locked in stand-off for more than two months, the South Asian nation¡¯s foreign ministry said on Monday.
The decision comes ahead of a summit of the BRICS nations - a grouping that also includes Brazil, Russia and South Africa - in China early next month, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend.
"In recent weeks, India and China have maintained diplomatic communication in respect of the incident at Doklam," India¡¯s ministry of external affairs said, referring to the area in the Himalayas close to the borders of China, India and Bhutan.
"On this basis, expeditious disengagement of border personnel at the face-off site at Doklam has been agreed to and is on-going," it said in a statement.
Chinese and Indian troops have been confronting each other close to a valley controlled by China that separates India from its close ally, Bhutan, and gives China access to the so-called Chicken¡¯s Neck, a thin strip of land linking India and its remote northeastern regions.India and China agree to end border standoff, India says
