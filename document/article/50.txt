¡¯Shanghai enterprise recruits professional sleepers for 100,000 RMB per year
A company in Shanghai is offering an annual salary of 100,000 RMB to recruit "professional sleepers." Since a major part of the job description is sleeping, netizens have deemed the position the most comfortable job in the world.
The employer is a manufacturer of dietary supplements. Apart from testing the products and completing research reports, candidates will need to experience the sleep situations of people from a variety of occupations in order to compile a comprehensive report on sleep quality. For instance, programmers have notoriously irregular schedules. The sleepers must therefore immerse themselves in the routine of programmers to evaluate their sleep quality, and then offer feedback and suggestions to improve it.
One employee of the company said that the position will also serve to remind people of the importance of sleep. The job doesn¡¯t require much from applicants, but a love for sleeping is a necessity. People from any major or profession are eligible to apply.
A career adviser told Beijing Morning Post that the position did not originate in China; it has been established in many large public hospitals throughout the U.S. The yearly income for the position can reach as high as $300,000 in America, where one-third of the population suffers from insomnia.
As Chinese people have put greater and greater emphasis on health in recent years, professional sleepers could easily see their stock rise in the next several decades.¡¯Shanghai enterprise recruits professional sleepers for 100,000 RMB per year
