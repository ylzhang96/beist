Young Chinese prefer quality life over new homes
More than 55 percent of college grads born in the 1990s would rather not buy homes if that means having to "bear the heavy burden of housing loans", said a recent blue paper by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Only one-third of graduates of the post-1990s generation are willing to compromise on quality of life for the sake of buying a home, it said. About 30 percent of them lived in a space of less than 20 square meters a year after graduation, but they are more willing to improve their life quality rather than having a larger living space.
Singapore¡¯s Zaobao.com reported on Monday that skyrocketing housing prices, along with the post-90s¡¯ pursuit of life quality and changed outlook, are spawning China¡¯s booming apartment rental business.
Liu Hui, 25, pays 4,200 yuan a month for a rented apartment, almost half of her monthly income, but she thinks it¡¯s worthwhile and is willing to spend 1,800 yuan more than her previous rent in exchange for a more comfortable life.
Housing prices in China¡¯s first-tier cities are more than 40 times the average income of residents, challenging young people¡¯s capability and willingness to buy homes, the report said. Young people in Beijing and Shanghai have already postponed buying their first homes, with the average age of 30 for first buyers in 2013 rising to 34 in 2016.
China¡¯s floating population reached 247 million in 2015, and the figure will rise to 282 million in 2020 and 327 million in 2030, meaning one-fifth of Chinese will be on the move over 10 years. As a result, living in rented homes may become a preferable lifestyle for most people.
According to a report by Beijing Homelink Real Estate Brokerage, China had 160 million tenants in 2015, a figure that could jump to 190 million in 2020 and 270 million by 2030.
Hu Jinghui, vice-president of real estate agency 5i5j, said some property developers rent out unsold homes amid housing purchase restrictions. A survey also indicated one-third of China¡¯s top 30 developers offer apartment rentals. Internet companies such as Alipay and Xiaomi also jumped on the bandwagon to take a share of the market.
Apartment rentals for young people, if supported by policy makers and based on good business models, can be an effective measure to curb housing rents and prices in first-tier cities, said industry insiders.Young Chinese prefer quality life over new homes
