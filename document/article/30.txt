4 things you should not talk in the office
1. Dollars and cents:
It¡¯s no secret that salary talk should be avoided, but it¡¯s no just paychecks that ought to remain private. Debt, mortgage, and loans ¡ª yours or anyone else¡¯s ¡ª are a personal concern, and if money matters come up, the best thing to do is to sidestep the subject and steer the conversation elsewhere.
2. Office rumors:
There will always be cubicle gossip, but that doesn¡¯t mean you need to participate. You want to be known for your work, not your rumor radar. Even if you trust a co-worker and your intentions are good, there¡¯s still a chance that you will be misunderstood, overheard, or otherwise caught up in the drama. Use your wit to comment on last night¡¯ TV highlights instead.
3. Job status:
If your boss offers you a raise or a promotion by all means. Celebrate! Call your family, but don¡¯t bring it up to a co-worker unless asked directly. Wait until an announcement is made or until your title officially changes; raising the subject yourself might seem boastful or rude.
4. Intimate issues:
Of course you will mention the happenings in your life to the people around you, but remember to set limits on what you reveal. Even if you feel close to your co-worker, and some things simply shouldn¡¯t be shared with office ¡ª mates. When in doubt, ask yourself if it¡¯s something you¡¯d want your superiors to know. That will put things in perspective.4 things you should not talk in the office
