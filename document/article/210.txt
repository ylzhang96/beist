China is Taking Credit For Inventing High-Speed Trains, Online Shopping
The internet recently raised its collective eyebrows after Chinese state media claimed that online shopping, high-speed rail, bike sharing and electronic payment systems are China¡¯s ¡°four new great inventions.¡±
Last week, government-run Xinhua News Agency said the country deserved credit for the discoveries, comparing them to the innovations of ancient China: compass, gunpowder, paper, and printing.
According to SCMP, the so-called ¡°four new great inventions¡± were based on last year¡¯s research conducted by the Silk Road Research Institute. In a survey, China¡¯s foreign students from 20 countries near the ¡°Belt and Road Initiative¡± were asked to pick China¡¯s ¡°four new inventions¡± that they want their home countries to use.
Xinhua¡¯s article noted that ¡°Among the four, high-speed rail and online shopping aren¡¯t from China, but we bring the inventions to the world¡¯s top level with our intelligence and innovation and make them China¡¯s calling card.¡±
However, just a little research will show that not one of the claimed inventions originated from China.
Online shopping was invented and pioneered by Michael Aldrich in the U.K. in 1979, while the Japanese operated the first modern high-speed rail in 1964.
Meanwhile, E-payment systems have been utilized in the United States since the 1990s, while bike-sharing services were already a thing in Europe way back in the 1960s.
Despite of the origins, in recent years, a number of China¡¯s technological innovations have been making their moves in the world. Among them, four stand out with a reputation of China¡¯s "four great new inventions" in modern times, which have made the daily life of the public more and more convenient.China is Taking Credit For Inventing High-Speed Trains, Online Shopping
