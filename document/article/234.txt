Postnatal confinement: A tradition to follow or abandon?
Editor＊s note: A young mother from Zibo, Shandong province, who died from severe heatstroke while taking part in ＊sitting the month＊, otherwise known as zuoyuezi, has placed the spotlight on the Chinese traditional custom. The practice of postnatal confinement, which require women to stay in bed, keep warm, not bathe or wash their hair, are still undertaken by some Chinese women today. Forum readers share their opinions.

Zuoyuezi is nothing like this. It requires the room to preserve warmth as women can be very fragile after giving birth. Woman are, however, still able to walk around in pajamas if the room temperature is stable. Postpartum confinement is good for women, which is why women enjoy the postpartum holiday for about half a year.

It should be abandoned as it belongs in a time when access to medical care was not what it is today. People should not expect to be treated in tax-funded public hospitals with western quality medicine if they refuse to accept instructions from the same level of professionals and instead choose suicidal practices like this.

Unfortunately, it is an old myth which simply refuses to go away. A woman should not be confined to her bed and kept warm or hot. Another useless tradition is a woman should not wash her hair for one month 每 hilarious but, unfortunately, very sad.

Women take zuoyuezi too literally. Taboos I find ridiculous and crazy include not having a shower or brushing your teeth, and just because these are traditions does not mean you have to abide them. We have to adapt our traditional practices to suit modern conditions and not follow them blindly.

A Western pregnant woman gets sheltered as much as a Chinese woman does 每 but I guess the time she spends in confinement, as you so quaintly put it, is limited to a few days or a couple of weeks. No, Western women also don＊t have to abstain from taking a shower. In fact, I seem to remember many expectant women go to special pregnant women fitness lessons. They do pregnancy exercises to keep their body fit.

In Germany, new moms can stay in hospital for up to five days after a normal birth and two weeks after a c-section. I think enforced confinement is unfair on the mother and the idea of not washing hair for a month fills me with horror. However, it would have been lovely to have been ＊looked after＊ for a month 每 to be fed, have the house cleaned, the shopping done so I could have just concentrated on my new baby.

If my mother-in-law had been here in Spain when her grand-daughter was born, she would have had a fit. My wife and I walked to a restaurant in a cold, northerly wind late in the evening, 36 hours after she gave birth. Even so, none of the forecast or predicted misery afflicted my wife. She was well rugged up against the cold. Chinese women are no different to other races, we are all human beings.Postnatal confinement: A tradition to follow or abandon?
