Women who show more cleavage in the workplace ¡®make better bosses and are seen as more powerful¡¯ says study
A revealing study has shown that women who show more cleavage in the workplace are seen better bosses and appear more powerful.
By contrast, bosses who buttoned up were perceived as less powerful and mature - undermining their influence on staff.
The study, published in the Journal of Social Psychology, found women who loosened their top few buttons were seen as more forceful - especially to female colleagues.
The outcome actually surprised researchers at the University of Wisconsin, who had expected a camisole to boost a woman¡¯s image.
¡¯In fact, not wearing a camisole under blouses made women appear more powerful,¡¯ researchers said.
¡¯These findings highlight the complexity of the messages shown by clothing.
¡¯It¡¯s clear that dressing provocatively can have negative consequences. But out findings suggest the right combination of clothing can also project power.¡¯
The study showed 170 women and 29 men various pictures of women at a desk and asked they rate them in terms of competence and leadership.
