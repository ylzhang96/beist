Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong jailed for corruption
A court in South Korea has sentenced Samsung¡¯s billionaire heir-apparent Lee Jae-yong to five years in prison for corruption.
Lee was convicted of bribery in a scandal that also saw the impeachment of South Korea¡¯s former president.
The case has gripped the public amid growing anger against South Korea¡¯s biggest companies, known as chaebols.
Lee, who denied all charges, had faced a jail sentence of up to 12 years.
Also known as Jay Y Lee, the de facto head of the world¡¯s largest smartphone maker had been detained since February on a string of corruption charges.
These included bribery, embezzlement and hiding assets overseas.
The 49-year-old is accused of giving donations worth 41bn won  to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of South Korea¡¯s former President Park Geun-hye, in return for political favours.
Prosecutors said the donations were made to Ms Park¡¯s confidante to win government support for a big restructuring of Samsung that would strengthen Lee¡¯s control over Samsung Electronics.
But Lee¡¯s defence team said that the payments were signed off without his knowledge.
Lee has previously admitted that the firm also gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Choi¡¯s daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, but denied seeking favours.
His lawyer said on Friday they would appeal against the court¡¯s decision.
"We are confident the ruling will be overturned," Song Wu-cheol said.Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong jailed for corruption
