New plastic 10 pounds  note featuring Jane Austen unveiled
The new plastic ?10 note has been unveiled by Bank of England governor Mark Carney at Winchester Cathedral.
The note, which follows the polymer 5 pounds , will be issued on 14 September and has a portrait of Jane Austen on the 200th anniversary of the author¡¯s death.
It is also the first Bank of England note to include a tactile feature to help visually impaired people.
Meanwhile, a limited supply of a new 2  pounds coin honouring Jane Austen has been put into circulation by the Royal Mint.
The coin will initially only be available in tills at key locations in the Winchester and Basingstoke areas that have connections with Austen, including Winchester Cathedral and the Jane Austen House Museum.
It will be circulated more widely across the UK later this year.
The Bank of England says the new 10 pounds  notes contain sophisticated security features and are expected to last five years, which is two-and-a-half times longer than the current note.
Security features of new 10 pounds  note:
A see-through window featuring the Queen¡¯s portrait.
Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back.
A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange.
A hologram which contains the word "Ten" and changes to "Pounds" when the note is tilted.
A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted.
A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letter JA.
Micro-lettering beneath the Queen¡¯s portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope.
The words "Bank of England" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note.
The tactile feature was developed in conjunction with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner of each note.
Bank notes are already in tiered sizes, and have bold numerals, raised print and differing colours to help blind and partially sighted people.
The Bank of Scotland unveiled the design of its new plastic 10 pounds  note at the end of May.
Featuring Scottish novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott alongside The Mound in Edinburgh on the front and the Glenfinnan Viaduct on the back, it also has a picture of a steam locomotive hauling a heritage tourist train.
The note is due to come into circulation in the autumn.New plastic 10 pounds  note featuring Jane Austen unveiled
