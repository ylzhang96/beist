Controversial study claims female pessimism keeps them from seeking higher salaries
Pessimism about their earning potential could be preventing women from pushing for higher wages or a promotion, according to a new study.
In turn, this could be helping to sustain the gender pay gap.
The study found that women tend to underestimate their earning prospects, while men often do the opposite, and researchers say it could help to explain why women are more often satisfied at work than men despite unequal pay.
In the controversial new study from the University of Bath, researchers concluded that pessimism among women could cause them to have little inclination to seek higher wages or even a better paid position.
Men, on the other hand, were found to consistently overestimate their own abilities.
The researchers analyzed the British household Panel Survey, a major longitudinal study, to track individuals¡¯ expectations of salaries ranging from unemployment to paid employment.
While women tended to have lower expectations, men were more likely to feel dissatisfied when the reality didn¡¯t match their outlooks, and consequently pursue better pay or change jobs.
¡®If low female expectations in terms of pay is fuelled by a pessimistic outlook, then even without discrimination and progression-related issues, women will continue to underestimate themselves and continue to inadvertently accept pay inequality,¡¯ said Dr Chris Dawson, Senior Lecturer in Business Economics.
¡®It has serious implications for policy that is trying to address the gender pay gap and suggests more needs to be done to actively advance women at work, without relying on them to self-select for promotion and senior opportunities.
¡®The takeaway message of this research is not about putting the responsibility on women, but recognising that without policy measures to address this, we run the risk of never closing the gender pay gap.¡¯
The researchers say the findings shed light on the complex nature of the pay gap.
It could also help to address the ¡®paradox of the contented female worker,¡¯ which describes the phenomenon in which women are more satisfied than their male counterparts despite being paid less.
¡®Whilst the role of unconscious bias in gender relations in the workplace has been well documented, this new research demonstrates the role of unconscious pessimism and passivity on the part of women,¡¯ said Professor Veronica Hope Hailey, Dean of the University¡¯s School of Management.
¡®It shows the importance of people management practices that enable and encourage women to progress and recognize their value.
¡®The onus is on policy makers and employers to foster female talent so that initiatives to close the gender pay gap can succeed.¡¯Controversial study claims female pessimism keeps them from seeking higher salaries
