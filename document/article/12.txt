How Bite Beauty is building an all-natural lipstick business
When Susanne Langmuir faces a big problem at Bite Beauty she asks herself: "What would Louis do"?
Louis is Louis Vuitton, the French designer who in the late nineteenth century turned a small box-making shop into a global luxury brand.
For Ms Langmuir, 48, "what would Louis do?" means: what¡¯s the correct course of action that won¡¯t compromise Bite¡¯s original values?
The Bite founder says: "Not compromising for me is about knowing what the pure idea is, and finding a way to get rid of obstacles that would interfere with that."
Her "pure idea" was to create line of lip products made solely from all-natural, food-grade ingredients. "You are what you eat. What you put on your lips, you eat," she says.
Bite Beauty was launched in 2012 in partnership with Sephora, the France-based chain of global cosmetics stores which began selling the products in its outlets. The firm also has "lip labs", where people custom-make their own lipstick.
Karen Grant, a beauty industry analyst at market research firm The NPD Group, says Sephora is a "great incubator" for small businesses. Bite¡¯s launch was master class in getting it right, she says, praising the sleek and edgy product design.
Major cosmetics production facilities said they could not produce formulas without at least some synthetic ingredients - a deal breaker for Ms Langmuir. So she built a lipstick factory in Toronto, where the products are still handmade.
Ms Langmuir, who sold Avon as a teenager and later worked as a cosmetics consultant for several companies, including Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, had some experience creating formulas.
Ms Langmuir says she and her 140 Bite staff are used to handling challenges.
Bite was not her first entrepreneurial challenge. Almost 20 years ago, she developed an organic face oil, but it never caught on with consumers. She also launched a perfume shop that was flooded with sewage water on its first day.
She describes herself as "a weeble-wobble" toy that bounces back after being knocked down. "There¡¯s always another way," she says.
The idea for Bite came from a gut feeling that there was an underserved market for all-natural cosmetics with an edgy, contemporary style.
In the spring of 2013, Bite held a promotional pop up shop in a Toronto Sephora store. She was given a window space to set up lab equipment and showcase how Bite¡¯s small batches of handmade lipsticks were made.
People were captivated. Three weeks later she leased a shop in the SoHo district of Manhattan to set up the inaugural Bite Lip Lab, where people could create shades on the spot, and select the finish and scent within half an hour.
There are now four Lip Labs in the US and Canada, and plans to open more in Los Angeles and other cities.
The Lip Labs have placed Bite at the forefront of what the industry considers a growing trend - bespoke beauty - and will be "a crucial, fundamental part of our growth," Ms Langmuir says.How Bite Beauty is building an all-natural lipstick business
