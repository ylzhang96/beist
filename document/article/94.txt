¡¯China View¡¯ helps build a better world
Since the 18th national congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) five years ago, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as its core has proposed a series of new concepts in the field of diplomacy, forming a distinctive "China View".
The "China View" does not solely concern China, but also offers a Chinese solution to the global challenges of peace, sustainable development and governance. It has helped build a better world.
NEW SECURITY CONCEPT FOR LASTING PEACE
In the 21st century, humanity is still grappling with an age-old question: How can we rid the world of war and conflict and realize lasting peace?
Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided the answer at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva: to establish a common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable security concept.
Xi¡¯s new security concept fits neatly with the current trend of globalization, peaceful development and win-win results through cooperation.
Guided by the concept, China has been playing an active role in global and regional security issues, helping solve some security dilemmas and shouldering its responsibility as a major country.
Regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, China has offered the "double suspension" proposal. On the Middle East, China created the four-point proposal for promoting the settlement of the Palestinian issue. On the South China Sea, China proposed that all parties involved properly settle disputes through consultation and negotiation.
On some unconventional security areas, China suggests all parties concerned abide by the principles of peace, sovereignty, inclusiveness, and shared governance so as to to cooperate in the deep seas, the northern and southern polar regions, outer space and the internet.
According to Vladimir Petrovsky, a researcher at the Moscow-based Institute for Far Eastern Studies, China advocates negotiation over force, an approach that has proven effective to maintaining world order.
Keith Bennett, vice chairman of Britain¡¯s 48 Group Club, said that China¡¯s new security concept is not based on a "zero-sum game" or a "winner takes all" approach but on the principles of equality, mutual benefits and peaceful co-existence, combining Marxism with Chinese traditional culture.¡¯China View¡¯ helps build a better world
