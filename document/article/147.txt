Pay-as-you-go gym latest innovation in China¡¯s sharing economy
Xiao Su, a workout fanatic, was surprised to find out that the nondescript booth he spotted on his way to the gym was also a gym.
"I downloaded the app for it out of curiosity. I have to pay 99 yuan ($14.86) deposit for registration with my ID number and phone number, and it charges me one yuan per five minutes," Su told the Global Times Friday.
The booths only have enough space to hold two people at once - but only one of them can exercise as the gym¡¯s sole piece of equipment is a treadmill.
The gym booth is also equipped with an air conditioner, a mini-television and fan.
"I prefer traditional gyms over this shared gym because they have more options for exercising and are much more spacious," said Su.
"Moreover, you can wash after working out in traditional gym. Who¡¯s willing to walk out all sweaty and smelly?" he added.
The gym booth app, "Mipao," only showed five booths available for users¡¯ to make appointment in Beijing on Thursday. After users make an appointment, they can access the booth by scanning a code on its exterior, according to the description on the app¡¯s iTunes download page.
The description explains that the application can record a user¡¯s movement and offer workout guidance afterward to "create a brand new, healthy and smart way of exercise."
China¡¯s first shared gym popped up in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China¡¯s Sichuan Province in February, the Chengdu Business Daily reported.
Unlike the Beijing running box, the Chengdu shared gym offers exercisers both machines and free weights, said the local newspaper report.
"Many of my colleagues have started using shared gyms because we usually have to get a yearly card with normal gyms, but with this one, you only pay when you use the machine," a Chengdu resident surnamed Tang, told the Global Times.
Tang said that he used to spend thousands of yuan on buying a yearly membership to a gym, but only worked out a few times a month. "I felt like most of the money I spent on the gym was wasted, but I only spend about 10 yuan every time I use the shared gym."
The shared gym concept is creative and shows that Chinese entrepreneurs are innovating in the shared economy, Hu Xingdou, economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, told the Global Times.
He noted that the sharing economy concept originated in the West, but China has an unmatched variety of sharing start-ups.Pay-as-you-go gym latest innovation in China¡¯s sharing economy
