Dalian Wanda¡¯s Wang speaks out against debt ¡¯rumors,¡¯ brings on new buyer for property sale
Wang Jianlin, chairman of Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda, defended his company¡¯s financial situation in a speech Wednesday amid worries about high debt levels.
The AMC Entertainment¡¯s debt risk has reportedly come under government scrutiny.
"Some people genuinely care about us, but others spread rumors and they hope for chaos," Wang said in a Mandarin Chinese speech in Beijing on Wednesday. "Some people have said Wanda has a debt of 400 billion yuan ($59.2 billion) or loans of 400 billion yuan from the bank, but this is completely wrong."
Wang was speaking at a signing ceremony for an altered deal to sell several of Wanda¡¯s hotel and tourism properties.
Wanda will now sell 77 hotels to Guangzhou-based R&F; Properties for 19.96 billion yuan and 91 percent equity share in 13 tourism projects to property developer Sunac China for 43.84 billion yuan, according to a statement. The total price of 63.7 billion yuan, or $9.3 billion, marks the second-largest deal ever in China¡¯s real estate industry, according to Reuters.
"Our cash flow will improve dramatically and we have decided to pay off most of the loans from banks," Wang said.Dalian Wanda¡¯s Wang speaks out against debt ¡¯rumors,¡¯ brings on new buyer for property sale
